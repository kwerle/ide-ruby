The makefile exists for convenience - since I don't have node installed.

Edit the package.json if needed.  `make shell`.  `yarn` in the shell.

You may need to move the existing ide-ruby out of the way:
`mv ~/.atom/packages/ide-ruby /tmp` (or somewhere)

`atom link`

atom .

Edit away.

Reload Window (cmd-opt-ctrl-l)
